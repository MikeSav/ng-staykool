# ngStayKool

## How to get this up and running?

### 0. Prerequisites
- [NodeJS & NPM](http://www.nodejs.org)
- [Ruby](htts://www.ruby-lang.org) (On MacOS and Linux you probably already have it installed)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (For compiling SASS / SCSS)

**If you not already have:**
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- [Bower](http://bower.io) `npm install -g bower`

### 1. Setup
After downloading or git pulling, go into the project directory with your terminal/console and:

1. ```bower install```
    - If Bower asks you which AngularJS version to use, choose **1.3.8**!
2. ```npm install```
3. ```grunt serve```
4. *Done.*

Don't just simply run `grunt`, this will fail due to lack of unit tests!
